# Ansible Collection - ibm.storage_virtualize

[![Code of conduct](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20of%20conduct-Ansible-silver.svg)](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html )

This collection provides a series of Ansible modules and plugins for interacting with the IBM Storage Virtualize family products. These products include the IBM SAN Volume Controller, IBM FlashSystem family members built with IBM Storage Virtualize (FlashSystem 5xxx, 7xxx, 9xxx), IBM Storwize family, and IBM Storage Virtualize for Public Cloud. For more information regarding these products, see [IBM Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/).

## Requirements

- Ansible version 2.14 or higher
- Python 3.9 or higher for controller nodes

## Installation

To install the IBM Storage Virtualize collection hosted in Galaxy:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install ibm.storage_virtualize
```

To upgrade to the latest version of the IBM Storage Virtualize collection:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install ibm.storage_virtualize --force
```

## Usage

### Playbooks

To use a module from the IBM Storage Virtualize collection, please reference the full namespace, collection name, and module name that you want to use:

```yaml
---
- name: Using the IBM Storage Virtualize collection
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Gather info from storage
      ibm.storage_virtualize.ibm_svc_info:
        clustername: x.x.x.x
        domain:
        username: username
        password: password
        log_path: /tmp/playbook.debug
        gather_subset: all
```

Alternatively, you can add a full namepsace and collection name in the `collections` element:

```yaml
---
- name: Using the IBM Storage Virtualize collection
  collections:
    - ibm.storage_virtualize
  gather_facts: no
  connection: local
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Gather info from storage
      ibm_svc_info:
        clustername: x.x.x.x
        domain:
        username: username
        password: password
        log_path: /tmp/playbook.debug
        gather_subset: all

### Other Feature Information
- SV Ansible Collection v1.8.0 provides the new 'ibm_svc_complete_initial_setup' module, to complete the automation of Day 0 configuration on Licensed Machine Code (LMC) systems.
  For non-LMC systems, login to the user-interface is required in order to complete the automation of Day 0 configuration.
- SV Ansible Collection v1.7.0 provided `Setup and Configuration Automation` through different modules. This feature helps user to automate Day 0 configuration.
  This feature includes three modules:
  - ibm_svc_initial_setup
  - ibm_svc_manage_callhome 
  - ibm_svc_manage_sra
- By proceeding and using these modules, the user acknowledges that [IBM Privacy Statement](https://www.ibm.com/privacy) has been read and understood.

### Prerequisite

- Paramiko must be installed to use ibm_svctask_command and ibm_svcinfo_command modules.

## Limitation

The modules in the IBM Storage Virtualize Ansible collection leverage REST APIs to connect to the IBM Storage Virtualize system. This has following limitations:
1. Using the REST APIs to list more than 2000 objects may create a loss of service from the API side, as it automatically restarts due to memory constraints.
2. It is not possible to access REST APIs using an IPv6 address on a cluster.
3. The Ansible collection can run on all IBM Storage Virtualize system versions above 8.1.3, except versions 8.3.1.3, 8.3.1.4 and 8.3.1.5.
4. At time of release of the SV Ansible v1.8.0 collection, no module is available for non LMC systems to automate license agreements acceptance, including EULA.
   User will be presented with a GUI setup wizard upon user-interface login, whether the Ansible modules have been used for initial configuration or not.


## Releasing, Versioning, and Deprecation

1. IBM Storage Virtualize Ansible Collection releases follow a quarterly release cycle.
2. IBM Storage Virtualize Ansible Collection releases follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
3. IBM Storage Virtualize Ansible modules deprecation cycle is aligned with [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/module_lifecycle.html).
