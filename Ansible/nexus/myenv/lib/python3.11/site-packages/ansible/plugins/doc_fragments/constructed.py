      - Use in conjunction with keyed_groups.
      - By default, a keyed group that does not have a prefix or a separator provided will have a name that starts with an underscore.
      - This is because the default prefix is "" and the default separator is "_".
      - Set this option to False to omit the leading underscore (or other separator) if no prefix is given.
      - If the group name is derived from a mapping the separator is still used to concatenate the items.
      - To not use a separator in the group name at all, set the separator for the keyed group to an empty string instead.
