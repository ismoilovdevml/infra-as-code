    - Tests if task finished in failure, opposite of C(succeeded).
    - This test checks for the existence of a C(failed) key in the input dictionary and that it is V(True) if present.
    - Tasks that get skipped or not executed due to other failures (syntax, templating, unreachable host, etc) do not return a 'failed' status.
